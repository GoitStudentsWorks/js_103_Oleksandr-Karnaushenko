# Hello, we are 30 Seconds to DEADline team.

The goal of the project was to create a responsive web page according to the
layout with using JS. We were given 6 days in total. On the first day, we
distributed responsibilities and got to work. Over the next 4 days, our team
created the website according to the terms of reference and passed all the
checks. On the last day we improved the optimization and made the last fixes. As
a result, we got a business card website that can be used as our portfolio in
the future.
